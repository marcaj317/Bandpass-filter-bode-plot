# Bandpass-filter-bode-plot
Consider designing a broadband Butterworth bandpass filter with a lower corner(cut off) frequency of 500 Hz and an upper corner frequency of 4500 Hz. The passband  gain of the filter is 20 dB. The gain should be down at least 20 dB at 200 Hz and 11.25 kHz. Use 15 nF capacitors in the high-pass circuit,and 10 kâ„¦ resistors in the low-pass circuit.
After designing the circuit, show the bode plot of the transfer function of the bandpass filter using Matlab.
